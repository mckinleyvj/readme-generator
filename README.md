  ## Description
  When we create an open source project, it's always a good practice to create a high-quality <kbd>README</kbd> file that will help developers understand the concept of why the project is made, how to install it, how to use it, how to report issues and how to make contributions that will highly likely gear the project towards success.

With the use of a command-line application, it will prompt the user a series of questions resulting to the creation of a well documented <kbd>README</kbd> file that can be used for their projects.
