  ## ✨Description
  When we create an open source project or repository, it's always a good practice to create a high-quality <kbd>README</kbd> file that will help developers understand the concept of the purpose of the project, installation steps, usage, how to report issues and how other developers could contribute towards the success of the project.

This project uses a command-line application, it will prompt the user a series of questions resulting to the creation of a well documented <kbd>README</kbd> file that can be used for their projects/repositories.
