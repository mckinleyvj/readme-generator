  ## Description
  When we create an open source project or repository, it's always a good practice to create a high-quality <kbd>README</kbd> file that will help developers understand the concept of the purpose of the project, installation steps, usage, how to report issues and how other developers could contribute towards the success of the project.

This project uses a command-line application, it will prompt the user a series of questions resulting to the creation of a well documented <kbd>README</kbd> file that can be used for their projects/repositories.

  ## Installation
  Lets check if the following packages are installed.

1. <kbd>npm</kbd> package

```bash
npm -v || npm -version
```

2. <kbd>node</kbd> package. Use the latest version or a version higher than 14.0.0

```bash
npm install n -g || npm install v16.0.0 (Specific version)
```

3. <kbd>inquirer</kbd> package. This will provide ease to the process of prompting questions, parsing answers and validating answers.

```bash
npm install inquirer
```
